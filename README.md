# DIY-Netflix-Recommendation-Engine
This is a Java-based recommendation engine for making movie suggestions based on a client's previous searches and preferences.
It follows along the lines of the Netflix recommendation engine.

The software spans a database containing movies along with their different characteristics. Based on this data, a series of recommendations are built 
for a given user as per his searches and preferences.
The strucutre of the software consists of multiple classes belonging to different modules. There are classes dedicated to dealing
with the database and then there are classes exclusively dealing with the recommendation logic.

The attached files consist of the source code and the multiple csvs simulating the database.
